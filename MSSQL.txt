#Files 
Problems related to Files:-
	Isolation of data 
	Integrity of data 
	Atomacity
	Updation,Insertion and Deletion Anamoly
	Concurrent access

#Mysql-> Relational database

Suppose there are two users Vivek and Devendra. The data related to both of them will be isolated. 

Schemas

LastName varchar(50) not null
id Int primary key

Relationship in Entites 
One to One 
In a school a student is allowed to take only one subject as optional subject 

Student(Entity) 1:1-> OptionalSubject(Entity)

One to Many 
In a school a student is allowed to take more than one sport
Student(Entity) 1:N-> Sport(Entity)

Mysql,PostgreSql,Oracle or Mssql is the framework.

#DDL-> Data defination language 
Create 
Alter
Drop 
Truncate 

#DML-> Data Manipulation Language 
Update 
Insert 
Delete 

#DCL-> Data control language
Projection
Selection

#TCL -> Transaction Controlled Language 
COMMIT
ROLLBACK
SAVE TRANSACTION 

Example
Insert (Devendra)-> Saved Devendra in database 
Commit

SAVE TRANSACTION A

Insert (Devendra)
SAVE TRANSACTION B 

ROLLBACK 

#States of SQL

Partially Committed  -> Failed -> Aborted(ROLLBACK)
Commited 
END

Any transaction that takes place in Sql has to atomic -> It has to take place in one go!

Properties of sql(ACID)
Atomic -> Whether is to completed or failed
Consistency -> The updation should take place correctly even if there is concurrent access 
Isolation -> When transaction takes place simultaneoulsy 
Durability -> THe transaction once started should take place even in failures (the transaction would be completed or failed)

#to see the present databases in our system
